Mobile network standard is defined by **3GPP**. If something goes wrong there its wrong everywhere. 
- Design flaw possible that affects everyone
The implementation of the standard is done by **vendors** like Samsung (implement flaw)
The configuration is done by **operators** like KPN. (config flaw)

Specification → Implementation → Configuration 

Flaws are inherited from one step to the next, and it’s not always possible to patch a flaw 
3GPP is responsible for the specification, vendors are responsible for implementations, operators are responsible for configurations
