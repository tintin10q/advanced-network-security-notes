Mobile network standart is defined by **3GPP**. If something goes wrong there its wrong everywhere. 
- Design flaw possible that affects everyone
The implementation of the standart is done by **venders** like samsung (implement flawk)
The configuration is done by operators like kpn. (config flaw)

Specification → Implementation → Configuration 

Flaws are inherited from one step to the next and it’s not always possible to patch a flaw 
3GPP is responsible of the specification, vendors are responsible of implementations, operators are responsible of configurations
