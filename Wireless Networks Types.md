- WMAN: Wireless **metropolitan** area network
- WLAN wireless **local** area network
- WPA: wireless **personal** area network 
- WBAN: wireless **body** area network 

These are different network types but each have their own standart:

- IEEE 802.3: wired Ethernet 
- IEEE 802.11: wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) 
- IEEE 802.15: wireless PAN 
	- IEEE 802.15.4: low-rate wireless PAN (ZigBee, WirelessHART, â€¦) 
		- ultra-low complexity, cost and power consumption, and low data rates 
		- inexpensive (fixed, portable, and moving) devices with no battery or very limited battery consumption requirements 
	- IEEE 802.15.6: wireless body area network 
		- short range, low power and highly reliable wireless communication in close proximity to, or inside, a (human) body 
		- data rates typically up to 10 Mb/s 
		- in entertainment and healthcare services 
- IEEE 802.16: wireless MAN (WiMAX) 
	- broadband wireless access systems

The difference between wireless and wired is only the bottom 2 layers:

These bottom layers of WiFi make it easier to evesdrop and allow for specific attacks like [[jamming attacks]].
