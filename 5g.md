5g promised things like

- Massive IOT
- Edge computing 
- Utra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) this Acronym goes to far
- AI

5G enables a new kind of network that is designed to connect virtually everyone and everything together including machines, objects, and devices. Very fast 20 GPS downlink and lower latency.

in 5g the eNodeB is called gNodeB. The epc is called 5GC.

There are two modes:

- 5g Non-Standalone (5g NSA) this is 5g network supported by existing 4g RAN and EPC.
	- This has Dual Connectivity: UE simultaneously connected to LTE cell and 5G NR cell
	- Best option for early deploymeent
- 5g Standalone (5g SA) 
	- Not relying on rg network RAN infrastructure, simpler and faster then 5g NSA

In the epc the MME is now called AMF (authentication mangement function). First entry point to the core network.

All the selling points happen in the MAC (medium access control) layer and Physical layer. Differnet way to duplex the frequency. 

In the **radio link control (RLC)**, data you can transfer upper layer data in 3 differnt modes: Acknowledged mode.  where you ack packets. In Transparent mode and Unacknowled mode you don't do much or anything at this layer.

The **PDCP** has encryption for user and control plane and integrity protection for control plane and now new in 5g optional for user plane but has to be supported. Its optional because it causes overhead. 

**Radio resource control (RRC)** is what establishes the RRC connection and assings [[RNTI]], establishes data bearers with gNodeB and does reporting 

The **nas** layers are independent of radio.
Then NAS-MM, NAS mobility mangement -> Mobility mangement if you move around in a car or something. Identity mangement before authentication, so that you always have a connection.
Suci encryption (encrypt permament identity) 

NAS Session Management (NAS-SM) establishes connection and manage communication links, assign ip addres and quality of  service. 

So its the same in UE just 2 NAS layers instead of one in control plane.

Then in the EPC they switched to a service based cloud function like infrastructure.

![[5g 5gc.png]]

AMF (Access and Mobility management) = Entry point for EU 
AMF is MME in LTE
UDM (unified data management) = stores user information, used by AMF, kind of like HSS in LTE.  
NRF (Network Repository function) = DNS for the system. 

What are possible challenges of the service-based architecture? 
- Correct implementation 
- Trust between entities

The services are communicating on a virtual bus based on https and rest with json, stateless (so they are cloud functions. They have state, but the protocol is stateless). This architecture allows to add new things. Documented with openAPI. 

Http responses:
1xx: information, 2xx success, 3xx redirection, 4xx client error, 5xx server erroro

## Interconnection 

Interconection is that you can connect to local network in other country and use credentials from home network. This means you got internal vs external networks. The pdn P-GW is the gateway to the internet. This is like NAT with wifi routers.  Only the GW has a true ip adress. Users get individual ip inside the network.

HPLMN is the home network.
VPLMN is the visiting network. 

### SEPP

## Enhanced subscriber privacy 


We already know that in LTE there is the [[Mutual Authentication and Key Agreement AKA]] when a UE connects to the eNodeB and EPC.  eNodeB only does relaying messages, the computations are done in the EPC. Only after the aka is done do we got authenticated encryption.

| |4G|5G|
|-------|----|----|
|Permanent|IMSI|SUPI|
|Temporary|TMSI|GUTI|

TMSI = Tempory mobile subscriber identity.  
SUPI = Subscriber unique permament identity 

GUTI = Global unique temporary identity 

If you send the IMSI/SUPI in plaintext this means the user can be identified by man in middle and tracked.  So until authentication you want to use tempory identifiers.  

Sometimes it is not possible to assign TMSI. 
This means that the eNodeB can actually always ask for the IMSI. In 4g the phone just gives it.

IMSI or SUPI catchers are fake eNodeB or gNode be that have a really strong signal. This way it appears the to be the basestation with the strongest signal. The UE connects and then the eNodeB asks the UE for the IMSI and the phone just gives it. The malicious eNodeB tricks UE into sending IMSI. This has been a problem since 2g. 

In 5g they thought about this a bit more. The idea is to send an encrypted version of the SUPI using ECIES, elipitc curve integrated encryption scheme. The public key of operator is in the sim. 
This turns the SUPI into SUCI, SUBSCRIBER CONCEALED IDENTIFIER. Only the 5GC can decrypt the SUCI back to SUPI. 

Now that you have this they can actually use the SUPI to make the GUTI. See below. 

![[5g identity exchange.png]]


The SUPI actually contains the IMSI and NAI (network access identity)
The IMSI has MCC and MNC (operator identifiers) and 
	MSIN (personal permament unique number). this is encrypted using fresh input and public key. 
The MSIN is the part you have to protect and gets encrypted.
I don't think you have to know this?

## SUCI captures 

While you can not get the MSIN anymore you can still know if a specific UE is around somewhere.

Basically you first capture SUCI from a phone. Then later you send this SUCI to a real gNodeB to start an [[Mutual Authentication and Key Agreement AKA|AKA]]. The 5GC will reply with a C and Auth that will only be accepted by the sim that made the SUCI. You can then relay this onto UE in the area and if the Auth of the 5GC is not valid then the UE will say hey its not valid. If it valid then you know that this SUCI was actually from the phone you want to track and it is around. 

So you got discovery phase where you capture the SUCI of target.
You got Attack phase where you see if the Auth token is accepted. 

![[Suci capture phases.png]]

![[5g suci capture attack phase.png]]

This does not scale well for many UE because you need a lot of messages and there is rate limeting and depends on SIM and UE implementations. But you can do it for like very targeted attacks.
